Deep metric learning has recently shown extremely promising results in the classical data domain, creating well-separated feature spaces. This idea was also adapted to quantum computers via *Quantum Metric Learning* (QMeL). QMeL consists of a 2 step process with a classical model to compress the data to fit into the limited number of qubits, then train a *Parameterized Quantum Circuit* (PQC) to create better separation in Hilbert Space. However, on *Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum* (NISQ) devices. QMeL solutions result in high circuit width and depth, both of which limit scalability. We propose Quantum Polar Metric Learning (*QPMeL* ) that uses a classical model to learn the parameters of the polar form of a qubit. We then utilize a shallow PQC with $$R_y$$ and $$R_z$$ gates to create the state and a trainable layer of $$ZZ(\theta)$$-gates to learn entanglement. The circuit also computes fidelity via a SWAP Test for our proposed Fidelity Triplet Loss function, used to train both classical and quantum components. When compared to QMeL approaches, *QPMeL*  achieves 3X better multi-class separation, while using only 1/2 the number of gates and depth. We also demonstrate that *QPMeL*  outperforms classical networks with similar configurations, presenting a promising avenue for future research on fully classical models with quantum loss functions.
