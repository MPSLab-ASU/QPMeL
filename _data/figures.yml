    QPMeL utilizes the surface of independent unit spheres as a unified feature space between quantum states and classical vectors. This unified space spans all unentangled quantum states. Once trained, a NISQ friendly depth-efficient circuit using only 2 gates per qubit encodes data.

    **QPMeL Encoder** consists of a standard metric encoder with a dense block appended to it. The final layer of the dense block is used as the input to 2 independent dense layers, which produce the angular coordinates $\vec{\theta},\vec{\gamma}$ . This is termed '*Angle Projection*'.

    Spherical feature space of quantum states ($S_S$) vs flat $\mathbb{R}^2$ space of classical vectors ($A_S$). Points that might be distinct and far apart in $A_S$ are the same point in $S_S$.
